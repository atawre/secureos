Setup: 
    2 users B and P
    2 files TD with policy (B,{B,P},{B}) and DB with policy (P,{P},{P}).
Bob (B) wants to utilize services of a professional tax preparer(P)
for filing tax returns, and submits his tax data (TD) to him.
Preparer has a secret database (DB) of tax optimization rules which he uses
for preparing tax forms for his clients.

Preparer reads TD and DB and prepares the tax form (TF).
TF will have label (P,{P},{B,P}). Note that TF is readable only by P.
For the result to be useful to B, TF has to be downgraded by adding B as a reader.
Downgrade operation is meaningful only during a live communication between parties.
It is found to be inappropriate for filesystem controls,
and hence the current implementation does not support it.

This example translates into the following setup in the Linux system.
2 users B and P, 2 files TD owned by B with 664 perms and DB owned by P with 660 perms.
A program for tax computation (TC) running with UID = P, reads TD and DB, and creates TF.
